<h1> As Harry would say  "Holy Cow !" </h1>
<br>



<h3> As we know (unless your a Sox fan) the Cubs battled thru 7 games this past week.  Each game was a nail biter and most stretched into the wee hours of the morning - all capped off with a day long rally in Grant Park. Actually the rally was just a few hours, but taking public transportation with an estimated 5 million others... we, lets just say that it was an experience that my kids will never forget.
<p> 
<h3> Due to the long awaited, yet highly anticipated (for 108 years) Cubs Win of the World Series </h3>
<h3> I was unable to complete the homework assignment to any satisfactory level.</h3>
<h3> So in it's place, I give you a little gimps into how Harry would have called the final game. </h3>
